# Data Interview 

Welcome to Tiller Interview repository. 

## Test 1

You have access to a single MySQL database (`oltp1`), which contains four tables:
- `store`: Contains information on a store;
- `product`: Contains information on a product;
- `sale`: Contains sale information;
- `product_store_relation`: Describes the relation between a product and a store.

You are required to:
1. Compute the total revenue generated by state;
2. Compute the average store revenue by state.

Write your code in `test1.py`. Your results should be stored into the SQL table `oltp1.report` (which you have to create and which should contain the results of both requirements).

## Test 2

This second test is almost the same as test 1. You still have a single SQL database (`oltp2`), which contains the same table as before. However, the structure of the `store` table has slightly changed.

You are required to:
1. Compute the total revenue generated by state;
2. Compute the average store revenue by state.

Write your code in `test2.py`. Your results should be stored into the SQL table `oltp2.report` (which you have to create and which should contain the results of both requirements).

## Test 3

The requirement has not changed. Again, you have accesst o a SQL database (`oltp3`) which has the same tables and structure as `oltp2`. However, some rows in `oltp3` have changed.
 In addition, you have now access to data located into `data/crm` which contain customers data. Use it efficiently.

You are required to:
1. Compute the total revenue generated by state;
2. Compute the average store revenue by state.

Write your code in `test3.py`. Your results should be stored into the SQL table `oltp3.report` (which you have to create and which should contain the results of both requirements).
